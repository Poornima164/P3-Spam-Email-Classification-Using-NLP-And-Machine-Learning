## **Setup and Installation**

### **Step-by-Step Installation**

1. **Download and Install Anaconda**
   - Go to the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/) and download the installer for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided by Anaconda.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and run:
     ```bash
     conda create --name spam-classifier-env python=3.8
     ```
   - Activate the newly created environment:
     ```bash
     conda activate spam-classifier-env
     ```

3. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repo/P3-Spam-Email-Classification.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd P3-Spam-Email-Classification
     ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Use `requirements.txt` to install the necessary libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - The `requirements.txt` should include essential libraries like:
     - `numpy`
     - `pandas`
     - `scikit-learn`
     - `streamlit`

5. **Open the Project in VS Code**
   - Open VS Code and ensure the Anaconda environment (`spam-classifier-env`) is activated for the workspace.

6. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**
   - Execute the notebooks one by one to preprocess data and train the model:
     - Open the notebook files in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook.
     - Run the cells sequentially to complete data preparation and training.

7. **Run the Streamlit App**
   - Launch the spam detection app with Streamlit:
     ```bash
     streamlit run spamdetector.py
     ```

## **Usage**

### **Running the Project**
1. Run the Jupyter notebooks one by one within VS Code or Jupyter to process and analyze the data.
2. After completing the notebook execution, use Streamlit to launch the spam detector app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run spamdetector.py
